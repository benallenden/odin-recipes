# odin-recipes

Project outline:
Create a website that consists of at least 4 pages. the first "index" page should link to the remaining 3. The theme for the website
is a collection of recipes, whether they are personal recipes or found on the web.

Refreshing my memory on HTML/CSS, really basic, didn't want to waste too much time tinkering!
